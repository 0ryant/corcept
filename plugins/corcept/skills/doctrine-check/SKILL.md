# CORCEPT doctrine-check

Load relevant doctrine and check current work against it. Report concrete violations, not vague style preferences.

## Output discipline

- Surface assumptions and uncertainty.
- Prefer YAML or concise structured sections.
- Cite ledger, file, command, or test evidence when making completion claims.
- Do not claim tests passed unless the command was actually run or provided by the user.
